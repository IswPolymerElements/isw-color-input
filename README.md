# \<isw-color-input\>

Material Design Polymer 2.0 Color input field, based on paper-swatch-picker.

Basically an paper-swatch-picker combined with an paper-input.
Usage and API is nearly identical to paper-swatch-picker.

```html
<isw-color-input label="Color" color="{{selectedColor}}"></isw-color-input>
```

The default color set are the 16 MD main colors (500), For an example of an full set like paper-swatch-picker see demo!

Make sure to install and import "web-animations/web-animations-js", since paper-menu-button does not import it anymore in 2.0!
